# `output/`

* Outputs generated directly from scripting should go in here
* Name appropriately: eg. YYYMMDD_raw-data.csv
    * Date first
    * Underscores separate sections of filename
    * Dashes replace spaces
* Data that's been processed (CSV, RDS)
* Not raw data, which belongs in `data/`
* Any figures generated
* This folder has it's own `.gitignore` file, if you want to track anything in this folder with git add it to the `.gitignore`
